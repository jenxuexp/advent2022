## Advent 2022
I wasn't sure I was going to do this, but here I am, doing this again. This year, I'm not going to stay up until midnight to do these, and I thought I'd use a different language than python, but I guess the saying is true.

### Day 1 blog
Pre-new year's resolution: I will not overthink star 1 to anticipate what I need to do in star 2. I also am going to try for the most efficient machine execution time where possible, in favor of compactly written code. Sorry Stephen, you're going to have to read paragraphs if you dig through my code.

### Day 2 blog
Well, I had to create a dictionary. And then I had to make another dictionary. And then I made yet another dictionary. I used to get a little salty about how much brent marin used nested defaultdicts, but now I realize (yet again) that brent knows what he's doing. Defaultdicts are amazing, although probably not necessary in this case. It saved me from copy pasting 12 new lines.

### Day 3 blog
So I read about this ord magic from day 2 and I'm glad I did. Then star 2 was being difficult because I forgot how popping from a list actually worked. Feeling the rust.

### Day 4 blog
Meh

### Day 5 blog
I tried to be too clever in star 2 when I should have just brute forced it, then ended up brute forcing it anyway because I got annoyed. itertools islice is still a little confusing to me, and then I realized you have to turn it to a list anyway...blech. Maybe I should've just built my own list indexer from the beginning.

### Day 6 blog
It's so simple, even a Jen could do it before her morning meetings
